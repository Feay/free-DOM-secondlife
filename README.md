free-DOM as in free for Doms, not your freedom. 
this is a clean room rewrite of a slave collar system for SL, in LSL script language
the goal is to be better than OpenCollar, which is a horribly low bar.
subgoal, no CS person style code. prefixing varibles with g or i or L or _ is absoluty agaisnt the spirit of the project
subgoal make as FEW scripts as possible, no linux person thinking with one million tiny one use scripts, such as OpenCollar
subgoal DOCUMENT API of at least ALL interscript linked messages, so anyone can easly make a mod, unlike opencollar
subgoal this is FOSS software, not opencollar, there will be NO belevelent dictators or cults of personality like Linus Torvis has. 
subgoal make a useful HUD, although this project is starting out with an awsome and sensible menu engine HUDs are the way. AND those huds must be mesh in as few as parts as possible, no more single button per object what is this 2006???
subgoal make menu system compatible with easy language changes, this is currently 100% done.
